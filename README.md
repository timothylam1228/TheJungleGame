The Jungle Game is a classic strategy board game popularized in China. 

Two players play on a board formed by 7 x 9 squares. There are three types of terrain with special properties
on the board: “den”, “trap” and “river”. Each player has eight different animal game pieces
with different level of power ranking. Starting from strongest to weakest, the rank of the
animals is: elephant, lion, tiger, leopard, wolf, dog, cat, rat.
Players take turns moving an animal piece by one square. The movement of a piece can be
horizontally or vertically but not diagonally. Animals can capture other player’s animal by
moving onto the piece’s place. Animal pieces may have special rules on several occasions
in terms of movements during special terrain squares and capturing.

The winning condition of the game is landing one of the pieces onto the opponent's den
square. Alternatively, the player can win by capturing every single one of the opponent's
pieces.
